#this is final processed kernow results after the dataWrangling.R file
#kernow1 <- read.csv("kernowResults.csv") - You can usually skip straight to this

#this is pure ratings only (now renamed kernowResults_ratingsOnly.csv):
#kernow2 <- read.csv("kernowResults220318.csv") 
# this was used originally in kernowResults.R which has now been moved to dataWrangling.R

#this is the raw original file
#kernow3 <- read.delim("kernow_results_26_03_18_IDS.txt")
#originally used in orderedKernow, now moved to dataWrangling.R

#this is final processed ratings file with all the additions after the dataWrangling.R file
#pdRatings1 <- read.csv("pdRatings.csv") 

#these are formatted for ordinal analyses in orderedKernow.R
#gDom <- read.csv("gDomD.csv")
#gPres <- read.csv("gPresD.csv")

#these have now been created for orderedKernow.R models (you can skip straight to here):
#gDomD_NA   (group Dominanca Data)
#gPresD_NA (group Prestige Data)
